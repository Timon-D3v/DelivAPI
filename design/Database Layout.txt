Create a new Schema


for each user: 
    - generate a new table: name = organization name
    table:
        - id: number
        - file: blob
        - mimetype: string

request: 
   api.timondev.com/cdn/<organization name>/<hex code>

   hex code: primary_id of the file + 500'000 (FILE_ID_ADDITION) in hexadecimal

   generate filename: primary_id + FILE_ID_ADDITION => HEX

   get primary_id from filename: filename - FILE_ID_ADDITION => BASE 10
